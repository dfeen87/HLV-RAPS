Overview

HLV Flight Middleware is an advanced safety and predictive intelligence layer designed to enhance aircraft reliability through the Helix-Light-Vortex (HLV) U₂→U₁ coupling theory developed by Marcel Krüger. The system introduces a dual-state modeling approach where aircraft power systems, sensors, and operational loads are represented not only by their physical state Ψ (voltage, current, temperature, cycles, and stress) but also by an informational state Φ that captures entropy, degradation, historical behavior, and geometric distortions in system dynamics. These two states are coupled mathematically through the HLV effective metric formulation 𝑔₍μν₎ᵉᶠᶠ = 𝑔₍μν₎ + λ (∂₍μ₎ Φ)(∂₍ν₎ Φ) allowing the middleware to predict degradation, forecast failure windows, generate optimized operating profiles, and detect early deviations in system behavior that typically go unnoticed in traditional flight software.

This framework was built specifically to operate as a drop-in enhancement layer for aerospace applications, integrating seamlessly between the flight computer and the underlying avionics or power systems. With real-time compatibility (10–100 Hz) and extremely low CPU overhead (<3%), it provides predictive health forecasting, optimal voltage/current/temperature recommendations, metric-stability assessments, and real-time warnings for accelerating degradation events. Engineers can adopt it with only a few lines added to an existing update loop, making it suitable for both new aircraft architectures and retrofitting older platforms. The repository includes the full 3600-line C++ implementation (hlv_flight_middleware.hpp), architecture documentation, and example integration patterns.

The project exists to advance safety, transparency, and intelligence in aerospace systems. Aircraft depend on long-lived components that operate under variable conditions, and the HLV approach introduces a new mathematical dimension for modeling stress propagation, thermal behavior, cycle fatigue, and emergent instability patterns. By offering this publicly under the MIT license, the goal is to empower aerospace professionals, researchers, and system integrators to explore a unified, physics-informed foundation for next-generation flight software. Contributions, forks, audits, and collaborations are encouraged. Special acknowledgment goes to Marcel Krüger for the theoretical foundation and continuous breakthroughs that inspired this implementation.
